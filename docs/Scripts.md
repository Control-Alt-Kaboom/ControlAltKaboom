# ControlAltKaboom - Scripts

The scripts included in this package are intended to run outside of the package scope, such as the backup script. It should be stated that this is a simple backup script, and while functional, is not intended for production/enterprise usage.

> With that said, there should be an understanding of liability and support - There is none.

## Backups

The backup script included provides connectivity with (remote/local) mysql databases, logging, rotation and compression. A simple Bash script, suitable for a cron-job.

See the complete [script](../scripts/backup/backup.sh) and [documentation](../scripts/backup/README.md) for more complete details.
